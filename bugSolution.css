The solution avoids using `!important` by restructuring the CSS rules and leveraging more specific selectors to achieve the desired outcome. 

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

/* or, if .child should always be red, regardless of its parent: */
.child { color: red; }
```

This corrected CSS ensures that the intended styling is applied based on correct specificity without the use of `!important`, making the CSS more manageable and easier to maintain.
